            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>Earth is a planet that was formed 4.543 billion years ago, and holds valuable life and resources found not on other planets. Earth contains approximately 7.8 billion people alive today, and if every human jumped at the same time, we would move only a single hydrogen atom away from the planet's current position. The Earth is the only planet in our solar system that has water on it.</p>
